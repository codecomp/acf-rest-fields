# ACF REST fields

Add ACF fields into existing REST endpoints without the need for custom endpoints or multiple requests with the following features:

* Select what post types to inject ACF fields into via the back end.
* Opt out of receiving ACF or choose what fields to retrieve on a request by request basis.
* Access ACF options page fields via a custom endpoint.
* Opt fields out of being available at all in the API.

## Installation

1. Upload plugin directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings > ACF REST Fields and select what post types to inject ACF fields into in the API


## Roadmap
* Add custom field content to taxonomy queries
* Add custom fields to Attachments, Widgets, Comments, Users
* Find solution to adding ACF fields to menu queries in other plugins
* Handle CRUD
